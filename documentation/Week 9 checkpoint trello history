Key Ideas from the Brainstorm:
Quiz creation

Users can import resources to make quizzes a

past papers/mocks

slides

a textbook

users can choose to make their quizzes public or private

Quiz management

filter by:

topic

difficulty of question

percentage correct

Teachers can assign quizzes to students/classes

See trends

which questions/topic students struggled with

 

Personalised Messages

links to stats for analysis/projection

“you’ve been struggling with X, wanna brush up on your knowledge?(link to quiz)”

“To get to your goal of XX% on the quiz next week, you should ….”

Tracking, analysis and projection of progress

Users can see performance trends

Student and Teacher views

student sees their quizzes, their classes etc..

teacher can select to see a particular student, a particular class, particular topic or particular quiz

Aesthetics

graphics?

fortune cookie

motivational quotes

stat breakdowns (daily, weekly etc..)

Java Classes

users

students

teachers

authentication

needs and interface

quiz

classroom

the group of students

personalised messages

performance analysis

abstract?
