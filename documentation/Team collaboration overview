Over the past two weeks, our team has worked consistently using a variety of tools and communication methods. Weâ€™ve been using Trello as our project management system to create a backlog, track and assign tasks to each member of the team. We hold biweekly meetings to discuss our progress and assign our next tasks, communicating mainly via Discord. Everyone has contributed to our MosCow user story creation and UI sketches, with multiple commits on Git.
