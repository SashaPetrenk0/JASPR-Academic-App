Timeline:
The intended release date is the 30th May 2025, where the entire application with a fully developed graphical user interface will be rolled out.

Resources:
Team Members:  The team members operating on this project include Roman Pearson, Pragati Vijayakumar, Sasha Petrenko, Jamie Corrie and Audrey Wren. These team members will be utilising Agile methodologies as a project management approach through GitHub. 
Tools and Infrastructure: 
-	Trello is our chosen project management tool (PM) which houses our product backlog and two-week sprints
-	Git-Hub is our chosen location to house our files (documentation folder)
-	Discord is our main communication channel, where our server is split into channels pertaining to specific tasks and team members

Dependencies: Dependencies include bi-weekly checkpoints with the client aligning with our sprint plans, and a prerequisite use of artificial intelligence in the development of the application. In this context, this will be implemented to generate quizzes for both students and teachers. 

Risk Assessment: Potential risks involve team members being unable to complete the “must-have” and “should-have” components of the product backlog. To mitigate this risk, having a thorough sprint plan for the next few weeks planned in advance ensures that critical deadlines are enforced and all the main functionality is complete. 
Another risk involves the project code breaking. This can be mitigated by testing new code in a separate, appropriately named branch before merging it with the master, to test for potential bugs. Additionally, have a dense, frequent commit history with descriptive, appropriately named commit messages allows the error to be tracked backwards and quickly remedied.
