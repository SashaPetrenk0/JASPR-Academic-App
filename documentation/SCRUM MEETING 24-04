Notes from Tutor about Week 9 Video
•	Have slides mixed with screenshots
•	Easy to talk about nice and clear
•	Don’t all have to speak  
•	One person speak the whole time – maybe either Jamie/aud/roman
•	List of what we need to talk about on canvas
•	Being marked on how we use oop
•	Bro literally said to bullshit our way through this lol
•	Not testing sending and retrieving from the database – just testing data entry so error handling tests will be the bulk of it
•	Format and edit what were doing???
•	Login security
•	SALTING hash function for password
•	Highlight in the video that we have that
•	Data filtering ?? what does he mean
•	App itself
•	One page with a bit of functionality
•	Or a page with no real functionality and that still links to other pages 
•	Landing page needs to be high fidelity
•	(so we need to  figure out the design style we want to pursue (like what sasha sent maybe or something else) but make sure we have a really fire landing page 
•	Come up with a logo
•	We don’t have to have a lot of pages to do well
•	Unit is not about programming, more about project management – we can have someone who is doing just project management 
•	Expecting registration and lpgin and that the datasbe is working
•	Expecting a dashboard screen that looks nice
•	(don’t expect too much beyond that so were doing well)
•	But to get more marks they want us to show more so we should show everything we have planned to have
•	Submitting screenshots of project management
•	Overview of whose doing what on Trello
•	Should be able to search for who is doing each thing
•	(a screeshot of what each person is doing on Trello)
•	Show that we a really using the trello 
•	Sorting by member, sorting by completed/not completed ETC
